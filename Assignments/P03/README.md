## P03 KnuckleBones SFML
### Daniel Granados
### Description:

This program is a simulation of the dice-based game "Knucklebones" using SFML. The game features a main menu, an unfinished dice animation triggered by a button press, and interactive grids for tracking dice rolls. Press the "Roll!" Button to trigger the dice roling animation, accompanied by background music and sound effects. The game assets, such as images, fonts, and sound files, are organized in the media/ folder. It's an unfinished project, what I have done is the main menu, background music, some sound effects, game outline.
