All class definitions will have at a minimum: 
1) a default constructor (zero params), 
2) an overloaded constructor(all data member params), 
3) getter and setter methods (two methods per data member one to "set" the value and one to "get" the value)

Any other methods or constructors will be based on what you see in the usage.

#Encapsulation: 
The packaging of data and methods together in the same construct which allows us to hide some of the inner
goings on from the world.

#Inheritance: 
Defining a set of classes in a hierarchical manner so that as we move down the hierarchy the classes below 
can re-use the data and methods from the classes above. And by adding or changing things in a small way we can quickly
change the behavior of a lower class without lots of effort or code.

#Polymorphism: 
Changing the behavior of a class by overloading or overriding methods from a class higher in the hierarchy to 
change the behavior of that higher class. Basically this means we can alter the behavior or adapt the behavior of a data 
type based on the context in which its used.
