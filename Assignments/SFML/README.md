## P03 KnuckleBones SFML
### Daniel Granados
### Description:

This program is a simulation of the dice-based game "Knucklebones" using SFML. It includes a variety of custom classes designed to manage gameplay, from rolling dice and placing values on a grid, to interacting with a user interface. The game will handle proper formatting, user inputs, and game logic. This project is built with an emphasis on overloading to handle arithmetic operations and custom methods to ensure gameplay mechanics follow the standard rules. The program also includes utilities for debugging and logging to make tracking the game code easier.
