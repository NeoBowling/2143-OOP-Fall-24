False. Composition is often preferred over inheritance for flexibility and better design.
Diffeent kinds of inheritance

## Major Topics
### Overloading
### Overriding 
### Composition/inheritance 
### Virtual / Pure virtual 
### Access specifiers 
#### Public remain public when derived/inheritance, Protected stays protected in the derived class, private stays private no matter what.
