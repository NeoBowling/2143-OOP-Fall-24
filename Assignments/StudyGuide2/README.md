This is also known as a function, it just resides within a class.
This can be called even if no objects of the class exist.
There is only one copy of this which is shared by all objects of the class,
This is what you get when you have at least one pure virtual member function defined.
This can be done in a class or outside of a class. It happens when you share the same name, but not the same parameter list.
This happens when you share the same name, but are in different classes. \solutionline[maroon]{??} {Overriding needs more}
You define arithmetic operators for your own class. This is an example of: ___.
You have a simple problem where you need to give elevated access to a class, but inheritance is not that answer. So you label this class as ___
This is a term not necessarily from C++, but definitely exists in other OOP languages. Where C++'s version would require a single pure virtual function, other languages assume no data and no implementation at all.
This is basically a contract agreeing that at some point, you may redefine some method in a child class. Virtual(is like a contract
This thing resides in memory and has its own state. Object
The level of access known as ___ can only be circumvented by another entity by giving that entity the Friend label.
What type of inheritance are you seeing in the graphic below?
An instance variable is the exact same thing as a ___ variable unless they are in an abstract base class. \solutionline[maroon]{??}{Bad Question}
In a somewhat oversimplified view of OOP, ___ deals with hiding things and ___ deals with exposing things. \solutionline[def]{23,17}{Encapsulation, Abstraction}
An abstract method is just a regular method in many instances. When we set an abstract method equal to zero we turn it into a ___
By defining a base abstract method as pure public, you are guaranteeing that any ___ access level will not cause problems in a derived class. \solutionline[maroon]{??}{No Answer} - Private - nothing can't access it, Protected - nothing can't access it execept derived class and friends, Public- free use
Short Answer. Write a simple example in Python (using class names like A, B, and C) showing:
Given the code in snippet 2, write a class called Customer that can access both the account_number AND the account_balance if possible. If not explain why and make any fixes necessary to Account.
Short Answer. Explain and write an example in C++ describing the diamond problem and how to fix and/or avoid it.

Diffeent kinds of inheritance
## Major Topics
### Overloading
### Overriding 
### Composition/inheritance 
### Virtual / Pure virtual 
### Access specifiers 
#### Public remain public when derived/inheritance, Protected stays protected in the derived class, private stays private no matter what.
