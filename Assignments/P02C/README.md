## P01 Fraction Class
### Daniel Granados
### Description:

This program will create a class called function and will formate the given numbers in a "_ / _" setup. It will 
read in input from a file and assign the values into the format, it will overload the operators +, -, *, /, ==
The methods will have the neccesary code to adjust the fractions utilizing the overloaded operators, with respect 
to the mathematical rules of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions. This program will have two special
functions that allow us to get the prerequisite information which is the greatest common factor and the least factor to 
go ahead and proceed with the calculations, along with a function that will change the result into the simpliest form.
